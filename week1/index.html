Foundation - is often talked about in the context of building a structure/system. In this context, the soil has to be compacted to withstand the weight of what is built on top. 
<p>
But what if the foundation we build is for a change/growth, and not for a fixed structure? 
</p>
<p>
Then the soil itself becomes the foundation and the structure itself. It needs to be able to hold the seeds, but it also needs to be aerated for the roots to grow.
</p>
<p>
    The foundation is no longer a fixed stage of a building process, but an ever-changing condition.
 worm aerates the soil and eats the compost to digest/distribute the nutrients. 
 </p>
 <p>
 A worm is a fragile being, but its flexibility and diligence maintain the soil in a state for change/growth.

    <p> Lets try making some lightweight structures that allow for growth, accumulation, reflection. </p>
    <h3>EXERCISE: Two song playlists</h3>
<p> Since 2016, I've been practicing making two-song playlists. I often wake up with a song stuck in my head. Most of the times, its from my childhood, or I heard it in passing and I won't remember the title. Then, I would spend so much time trying to identifying the song (For example, I would call my sister and hum the melody). </p>
<p> So I decided to give these songs a home. </p><br>

<h2> the structure </h2>
<ul>
    <li>The first song of the playlist would be a song that you wake up thinking about.</li>
    <li>Then you have to find a second song that makes sense (to you) to pair with the first song.</li>
    <li>Title the playlist by the date.</li>
</ul>


<p>here's a playlist I made on the way to the first day of Ultralight!</p>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1t6V5M5ZCpdVKPqOD3epNy?si=85a601e594ea47e8/">1/16/24</a> 
<p>and here's a playlist I made recently that I am proud of.</p>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4j6vOQf6sJCUGbeOVZ7C8b?si=f791fe7375c5442d">1/4/24</a>
<p>this is one of the first playlists I made (I had to retrieve it from my old Tidal account)</p>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5miFQVdgYgYVNsz2bStz7l?si=51aebbca2ed643dd">5/26/16</a>
<p>*I no longer let myself choose a song from the same album as the first, but its not a hard rule. </p>

    <h3> soft structures </h3> 
    <p> I’ve been thinking about my dislike for the word “structure”. Similar to “discipline”, it felt forceful, like an external pressure to shape a behavior. 
</p>
<p> In contrast, I’ve always been fond of the word “pattern”. It feels more lightweight, something that is found, accumulate over time. (Although in fashion, “pattern” can also be pretty rigid for practical reasons like consistency… to fit a body…)
</p>
<p>
Once you find a “pattern” is found, and you want to continue it, does it become a “structure”? </p>
